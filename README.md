# CoinTracker

The front-end for a progressive web app built using React, and designed to track the price of BTC, ETH and LTC cryptocurrency prices. The app can be customised to become a PWA, and easily updated to track prices in real time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
